Map method in js :
1. Map is a array method which iterates and perform the logics for each element and returns the value

2. reduce finally returns the single value


















Tasks:
1. Repeat the class 
2. React.dev check first 4 sections in describing UI 
3. How to write code without JSX
4. Git push based on the branches


JSX Concepts :
JSX Stands for javascript and XML
JSX Syntax will be followed by the react 
JSX allows us to write markup(HTML) inside our js file
Using JSX i can write js and html together without taking separate file or scripts

ES 6 features 
1. Arrow functions
2. let const
3. destructring
4. promises 
5. modules 
6. rest operators and spread operator 
7. string liternals
8. Ternary operator


rules of JSX :
1. Every component must return single parent (container ex : div , ol , react fragment etc)
2. while writing js code always use curly braces inside the return
3. class must be replaced with className
class is predefined keyword in react for creating the class components 
4. Every attribute must be lowerCamerCase



1. Ternary operator :
  

  condition ? expression1 : expression 2


  To render screen conditionally : we use Ternary operator mostly in react

  conditional rendering in react :

  1. if /else
  2. ternary operator
  3. logical operator or short-circuit operator &&


  exports and imports in react 
  They are 2 ways to export the component or function or variable 

  1. Default export
    Every module or file can contain only one default export
    Default export is imported with any name 

  2. Named export 
    Every module or file can contain multiple name exports
     Named export is imported with the  defined name , we have special case , using this we can import with 
     any name (as)


    React fragmenst s:
    React fragments are empty containers which acts like a shared parent obeying jsx first rule
    we can eliminate extra div
   
    There are 2 ways to use React fragements
    1. <></>
    2. <React.Fragment></React.Fragment>


4 step 
1. Define the things
2. Explain the things
3. Syntax of the things 
4. write the things
